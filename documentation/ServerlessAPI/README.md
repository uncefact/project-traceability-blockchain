# Serverless API

Here the operations of serverless APIs that enable interaction with the blockchain are briefly described.  
In order to test the API (after the serverless infrastructure has been recreated on your GCP environment) a Thunder Client collection is pre-configured and it is inside the "thunder_client" folder.
The same folder is inside the `unece-cotton/cloud_functions/.vscode` one and it is used by the Visual Studio Code extension "Thunder Client".
